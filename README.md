# React Website Template

This is a React web template for the purpose of showcasing 
projects/assignments created in a classroom setting. This React template
is built on top of [Treact](https://treact.owaiskhan.me/), a React theme 
created by [Owais Khan](https://owaiskhan.me/).

## Getting Started

1. Create a [new repository based off this web template](https://github.com/krocketeer/website-template/generate)
2. Edit the following files `About.js`, `Footer.js`, and `Cover.js` with your own personal and course information
3. [Deploy your web app to Firebase](https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-deploy-a-react-app-with-firebase-hosting-98063c5bf4250) 
(Note: it is possible to [deploy React sites to Github Pages](https://dev.to/yuribenjamin/how-to-deploy-react-app-in-github-pages-2a1f), 
but I've had the best experience using Firebase)

#### Local Development
To run the website locally
1. Run `npm install` to install local dependencies
2. Run `npm start` to start the React app
3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view project in the browser
